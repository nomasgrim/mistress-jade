Fluidity contains a complete CSS reset, some base-line typography, a grid system that can be used semantically or with inline classes to create both fluid-width and fixed-width designs, a collection of transparent mixins that gracefully handle browser pre-fixes for CSS3 properties, and it also has some optional modules for forms and common UI elements.\n\nInstall ( Quickstart )\n=======\n___For Complete Documentation visit [FluidityCSS.com](http://fluiditycss.com/)___\n\nAssumes you already have an up-to-date and working Node.js environment.\n\nMake sure you have stylus installed.\n~~~ sh\nnpm install stylus -g\n~~~\n\nInstall Fluidity in your Project\n~~~ sh\nnpm install fluidity\n~~~\n\nIf you are using Connect Assets you can begin using Fluidity within your stylus files use the @import rule provided by Stylus\n~~~\n@import \"fluidity\"\n~~~\n\nYou should also be able to process .styl files into CSS at the commandline with the stylus command. \nIn order for stylus to find Fluidity you can use the \"--use\" switch.\n~~~ sh\n stylus file.styl --use ../fluidity/lib/fluidity\n~~~",
